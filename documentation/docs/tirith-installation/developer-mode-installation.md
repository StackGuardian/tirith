For developers who want to contribute to Tirith, setting up a [Dev Container in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_create-a-devcontainerjson-file) offers a robust development environment. This approach ensures that all dependencies and configurations are consistent across different setups.

## Prerequisite
- Make sure your machine has [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed.
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine.
- Basic knowledge on [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is required.

## Steps to Install Tirith

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the Tirith repository from GitHub to get the latest code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StackGuardian/tirith.git
cd tirith
```

### Step 2: Set Up Docker
Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and running on your machine. You can manage Docker using Docker Desktop or the command-line interface (CLI). Docker allows you to run Tirith within isolated containers, preventing any dependency conflicts with your local system.

### Step 3: Open the Project in VS Code
- Launch Visual Studio Code and open the cloned repository folder.
- Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
- Search for **Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container** and select this option.
- VS Code will use the `devcontainer.json` configuration file within the project to build a containerized environment for Tirith. This configuration file contains settings for the development environment, such as necessary extensions and dependencies. Building the container may take a few minutes.
- Once the container is running, youâ€™ll have a fully configured development environment within Docker, optimized for Tirith development.
