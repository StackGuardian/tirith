### Submit Feedback

Please use GitHub Discussions to submit feedback and engage with community [https://github.com/StackGuardian/feedback/discussions/8](https://github.com/StackGuardian/feedback/discussions/8).

## Basic guidelines

### Commits

-  Use the imperative, present tense («change», not «changed» or «changes») to be consistent with generated messages from commands like git merge.
- Describe the changes you have made

### Pull Requests

- **Stay Updated**: Make sure your PR is based on the latest code from the `main` branch.
- **Clear Title and Description**: Try to include a clear, descriptive title and a detailed explanation of your changes.
- **Reference Issues**: If applicable, link to related issues and PRs.
- **Pass Tests**: Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR.
- **Be Open to Feedback**: We're all here to help each other improve, so please be open to feedback and ready to make adjustments.

### Issues

- **Search First**: It helps to check if your problem or feature request has already been discussed before opening a new issue.
- **Be Detailed**: When you open a new issue, providing as much detail as possible really helps. Feel free to use our templates for bugs and feature requests.
- **Be Respectful**: Let's all be kind and considerate in our communication.
- **Solving Issues**: Don't take on more than 3-4 `good first issues` at once, and work on only one issue at a time.

Thank you for taking the time to help improve our project!
