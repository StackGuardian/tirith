## Basic guidelines

For all changes you commit or submit by pull-request please follow these simple guidelines:

### Advice on pull requests:

- Raise Pull Request as soon as you start working on a feature, bug, test or hotfix and label it with `work-in-progress`, while it is not ready to be merged.
- Commits or squashed commits in your pull-requests should have a useful description.
- Always update CHANGELOG.md before merging Pull Requests.

### If you have commit access:

- Do NOT use git push --force.
- Do NOT commit to other contributor's branches without their consent.
- Use Pull Requests if you are unsure and to suggest changes to other maintainers.
