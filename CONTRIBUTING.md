We use GitHub issues to track bugs at [https://github.com/stackguardian/tirith/issues](https://github.com/stackguardian/tirith/issues). Please use Bug report issue template.

### Fix Bugs and implement features

All contributions to solve GitHub issues tagged with "bug", "enhancement" and "help wanted" are most welcome and greatly appreciated.

### Documentation

Trith could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Tirith docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

Please use GitHub Discussions to submit feedback and engage with community [https://github.com/StackGuardian/feedback/discussions/8](https://github.com/StackGuardian/feedback/discussions/8).

## Basic guidelines

### Commits

-  Use the imperative, present tense (Â«changeÂ», not Â«changedÂ» or Â«changesÂ») to be consistent with generated messages from commands like git merge.
- Describe the changes you have made

#### Examples
**Good example**: 
 - Commit Message:\
  `Add feature to calculate total monthly cost for AWS resources`

- Description:\
`Implement a function that calculates the total monthly cost for AWS resources. Update the documentation to reflect this new feature.`

  Why itâ€™s Good:
    > **Clarity**: Clearly states the action and the feature.\
    >**Specificity**: Specifies what the feature is and what it affects (AWS resources).\
    >**Consistency**: Uses imperative, present tense, aligning with best practices.


**Bad Example**:  
- Commit Message:\
  `Fixed some stuff`
- Description:\
`Made changes to the code to fix issues. Updated a few things here and there.`
  Why itâ€™s Bad:
    > **Vague**: Does not explain what was fixed.\
    > **Lacks Detail**: Provides no insight into what "stuff" refers to or how it was changed.\
    > Does not use imperitve present tense.

### Pull Requests

- **Stay Updated**: Make sure your PR is based on the latest code from the `main` branch.
- **Clear Title and Description**: Try to include a clear, descriptive title and a detailed explanation of your changes.
- **Reference Issues**: If applicable, link to related issues and PRs.
- **Pass Tests**: Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR.
- **Be Open to Feedback**: We're all here to help each other improve, so please be open to feedback and ready to make adjustments.

### Creating Issues

- **Search First**: It helps to check if your problem or feature request has already been discussed before opening a new issue.
- **Be Detailed**: When you open a new issue, providing as much detail as possible really helps. Feel free to use our templates for bugs and feature requests.
- **Be Respectful**: Let's all be kind and considerate in our communication.

### Solving Issues

- Limit yourself to solving a maximum of four `good first issues`. Once you've reached this limit, consider tackling other types of issues.
- Please work on only one issue at a time.
- Please ask for assignee before working, and if there's no update for about a week on a particular issue, we'll remove the assignee.

Thank you for taking the time to help improve our project!
