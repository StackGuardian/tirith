# Tirith (StackGuardian Policy Framework)

## A call for contributors

We are calling for contributors to help build out new features, review pull requests, fix bugs, and maintain overall code quality. If you're interested, please email us at team[at]stackguardian.io or get started by reading the [contributing.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Tirith scans declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations like Terraform against policies defined using JSON.

## What is Tirith?

Tirith is a policy framework developed by StackGuardian for enforcing policies on infrastructure configurations such as Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes etc. It simplifies policy creation and enforcement ensuring compliance with infrastructure policies through a user-friendly approach.

## Who is the project for?
- DevSecOps engineers
- Infrastructure architects
- Cloud administrators
- Anyone involved in managing and enforcing infrastructure guardrails

## Features

- An easy to read and simple way to define policy as code against structured formats.
- Use providers to define policies for terraform plan, infracost or any abstract JSON.
- Easily evaluate inputs against policy using pre-defined evaluators like ContainedIn, Equals, RegexMatch etc.
- Write your own provider (plugin) by leveraging a highly extensible and pluggable architecture to support any input formats.

<!-- ## Feature Road-map

This is only a list of approved features that will be included in Tirith over the next iterations.

- Extended support for Terraform Plan
- Support for Cloudformation and ARM
- Extended library of evaluator functions -->

## Usage

```
usage: tirith [-h] [-policy-path PATH] [-input-path PATH] [--json] [--verbose] [--version]

Tirith (StackGuardian Policy Framework)

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -policy-path PATH  Path containing Tirith policy as code
  -input-path PATH   Input file path
  --json             Only print the result in JSON form (useful for passing output to other programs)
  --verbose          Show detailed logs of from the run
  --version          show program's version number and exit

About Tirith:

   * Abstract away the implementation complexity of policy engine underneath.
   * Simplify creation of declarative policies that are easy to read and interpret.
   * Provide a standard framework for scanning various configurations with granularity.
   * Provide modularity to enable easy extensibility

## Example Tirith policies

[Examples using various providers](tests/providers)

1. VPC and EC2 instance policy (using Terraform plan provider)

- AWS VPC instance_tenancy is "default"
- EC2 instance cannot be destroyed

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "required_provider": "stackguardian/terraform_plan",
    "version": "v1"
  },
  "evaluators": [
    {
      "id": "check_ec2_tenancy",
      "provider_args": {
        "operation_type": "attribute",
        "terraform_resource_type": "aws_vpc",
        "terraform_resource_attribute": "instance_tenancy"
      },
      "condition": {
        "type": "Equals",
        "value": "default"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "destroy_ec2",
      "provider_args": {
        "operation_type": "action",
        "terraform_resource_type": "aws_instance"
      },
      "condition": {
        "type": "ContainedIn",
        "value": ["destroy"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "eval_expression": "check_ec2_tenancy && !destroy_ec2"
}
```

2. Cost control policy (using Infracost provider)

- EC2 instance cost is lower than 100 USD per month

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "required_provider": "stackguardian/infracost",

      "provider_args": {
        "operation_type": "total_monthly_cost",
        "resource_type": ["aws_ec2"]
      },
      "condition": {
        "type": "LessThanEqualTo",
        "value": 100
      }
    }
  ],
  "eval_expression": "ec2_cost_below_100_per_month"
}
```

3. StackGuardian Workflow Policy (using SG workflow provider)

- Terraform Workflow should require an approval to create or destroy resources

      "provider_args": {
        "operation_type": "attribute",
        "workflow_attribute": "approvalPreApply"
      },
      "condition": {
        "type": "Equals",
        "value": true
      }
    }
  ],
  "eval_expression": "require_approval_before_creating_ec2"
}
```

4. Make sure that all AWS ELBs are attached to security group (using Terraform plan provider)

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "version": "v1",
    "required_provider": "stackguardian/terraform_plan"
  },
  "evaluators": [
    {
      "id": "aws_elbs_have_direct_references_to_security_group",
      "provider_args": {
        "operation_type": "direct_references",
        "terraform_resource_type": "aws_elb"
        "references_to": "aws_security_group"
      },
      "condition": {
        "type": "Equals",
        "value": true,
        "error_tolerance": 0
      }
    }
  ],
  "eval_expression": "aws_elbs_have_direct_references_to_security_group"
}
```

5. Make sure that all `aws_s3_bucket` are referenced by `aws_s3_bucket_intelligent_tiering_configuration` (using Terraform plan provider)

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "required_provider": "stackguardian/terraform_plan",
    "version": "v1"
  },
  "evaluators": [
